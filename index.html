            <strong>I am taking this class because:</strong>
            I have some background in web development from taking CSE 330
            as well as experience through internships, but most of it has
            been pretty basic. I want to expand my skills, and some of the
            assignments, like the personal webpage are things that I've
            been meaning to do anyways, but haven't gotten around to.
